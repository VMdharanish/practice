Reverse an Array in groups of given size

comments
Given an array arr[] and an integer k, find the array after reversing every subarray of consecutive k elements in place. If the last subarray has fewer than k elements, reverse it as it is. Modify the array in place, do not return anything.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], k = 3
Output: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 8, 7]
Explanation: Elements is reversed: [1, 2, 3] → [3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6] → [6, 5, 4], and the last group [7, 8](size < 3) is reversed as [8, 7]. 

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3
Output: [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]
Explanation: First group consists of elements 1, 2, 3. Second group consists of 4, 5.

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 8, 9], k = 5
Output: [9, 8, 6, 5]
Explanation: Since k is greater than array size, the entire array is reversed.
